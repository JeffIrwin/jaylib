# jaylib

Shader toy built with raylib 

The "jay" stands for "J"

## Prerequisites

I don't even know what all I had to install.  Just run it, google the errors,
and `sudo apt install -y` until it works.

- linux (wsl is fine)
- ffmpeg
- opengl
- various x11 and related libraries
- cmake

Raylib at least is automatically fetched via cmake

## Run

```
run.sh
```
